# PASBioPlusPlus
PASBio++ is a specialized corpus designed for enhancing Predicate Argument Structure (PAS) annotation in biomedical texts. PAS is an essential piece of linguistic information that conveys the entire main idea stated in each sentence, but biomedical PAS differs significantly from the general domain, necessitating a specialized corpus like PASBio++. This corpus offers both quantitative and qualitative improvements.

We present a comprehensive data augmentation method for the semantic role labeling (SRL) task specific to biomedical documents that utilizes the PASBio argument frames and 314 original PASBio example sentences. We aim to supplement this existing resource with additional labeled data through targeted data expansion. In terms of quantity, we have augmented the initial dataset to create a labeled corpus called PASBio++ that comprises 285,532 sentences. In terms of quality, our method was designed to enhance the quality of PASBio++ in various ways: Gammar variants, paraphrased variants, frame-based variants, and entity-driven variants.

We are pleased to state that the PASBio++ corpus is available for complimentary utilization by researchers engaging in non-profit endeavors. In order to access the corpus, we kindly request that you send an email to tnhduc@fit.hcmus.edu.vn simply informing us of your intended use. Upon receipt of this information, we will provide you with the necessary data decompression password.

We thank you for your interest in our corpus and look forward to facilitating your research endeavors.
